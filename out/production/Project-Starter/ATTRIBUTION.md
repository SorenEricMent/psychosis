refpolicy is an external community project at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy

It was supposed to be embedded as a git submodule but UBC's infrastructure doesnot support this.


No code from this project is actually used, this project, in Psychosis, serve as

- Policy project directory structure reference
- Basis of creating new projects

Though Psychosis does not strictly depend on it, Psychosis's initiative
is to work with it to build security policies.
